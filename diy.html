<h1>Hello! Welcome To Table And Chair.com</h1>
<p>This website, built in 1863 (when the internet was filled with nothing but Rick Rolls and YouTube videos using 
	Unregistered HyperCam 2), was created based on one simple idea. "What if someone wanted to build a chair? Or a table? Or what if
	we wanted to go one step beyond, and create BOTH? If these kinds of questions that some may call "crazy" infest your mind like a wasp's
	nest, you've come to the right place. Voted the #2 website for building tables and chairs for the third year in a row (screw you eHow, you stink, and your family stinks,
	and I've sent my dog to poop on your yard, AGAIN! HAHAHAHAHA!, we are a group of two guys who love nothing more than to see the faces on
	people who are giving our website at least 2 stars on Yelp, as well as seeing a completed table, chair, or some Power Ranger giant-robot-amalgamation of the two. That would be
	pretty freaking cool, if I do say so myself.
	<br />	<br />	<br />
	When interviewing us, people straight from the office of the New York Times had a lot to say about our website, such as "How did you get in here?", and "I'm calling the police
	if you don't leave NOW!, as well as, "This website sucks." (I think Brad shed a tear during that last bit of praise)
		<br />	<br />	
		Anyway, please enjoy our guides on how to craft the greatest creation of your entire life....
